# APVS
An atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability quantification system
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) makes up the majority of mortality induced by coronary artery disease. Identifying signatures for plaque destabilization and rupture is important for preventing the transition from coronary stability to instability and the occurrence of thrombosis events.

A machine learning-based integrative program containing nine learners was developed to generate a consensus classifier linked to atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability signature (APVS). The classifier displays the reliable performance and robustness for distinguishing ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) at presentation.

An APVS-based quantification system (APVSLevel) was also developed for the assessment of atherosclerosis severity and plaque vulnerability, and decoded the dysregulated mechanisms at single-cell resolution.
