An atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability quantification system

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) makes up the majority of mortality induced by coronary artery disease. Identifying signatures for plaque destabilization and rupture is important for preventing the transition from coronary stability to instability and the occurrence of thrombosis events.

This system provides a comprehensive quantification of atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, empowering early-warning capabilities and accurate assessment of atherosclerosis severity. Notably, it unravels the intricate multidimensional dysregulated mechanisms at an unprecedented high resolution.
